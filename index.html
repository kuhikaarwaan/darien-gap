              For decades, the Darién Gap was crossed by only a handful of adventurers each year.
              Today, it has become the deadliest corridor in the Western Hemisphere's migration
              crisis. In 2023 alone, more than 520,000 people — including more than 113,000 children
              — made this dangerous journey, more than double the previous year's record.
            </p>
            <p>
              They come from Venezuela, fleeing economic collapse. From Haiti, escaping gang
              violence. From Ecuador, China, Afghanistan, and dozens of other countries. All share
              the same destination: the United States, and the promise of something better.

                <h2>The Darién Gap</h2>
                <p>
                  A 60-mile stretch of roadless jungle separates Colombia and Panama — the only
                  break in the Pan-American Highway that otherwise connects Alaska to Argentina.
                  There is no route for cars, buses, or rail lines. Only smugglers' footpaths twist
                  through the rainforest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every crossing begins with this knowledge: once the pavement ends, there is no
                  official infrastructure until you emerge on the Panamanian side. Everything in
                  between belongs to the jungle and the groups that control it.

                <h2>The five-to-fifteen-day trek</h2>
                <p>
                  The trek takes migrants through dense rainforest, steep mountains, and
                  fast-flowing rivers. Temperatures reach 95°F with suffocating humidity. Crocodiles
                  stalk the banks, venomous snakes hide beneath roots, and flash floods arrive
                  without warning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Criminal gangs charge tolls or rob entire caravans. Each night in the jungle
                  carries the risk of injury, extortion, or disappearance for the families making the
                  crossing.

              <p>
                Migrants are crossing the Darién in record numbers. After a brief pause during the
                pandemic, unauthorized crossings through Panama exploded. Fewer than 9,000 people
                crossed in 2018; by 2023 the total hit 520,085 — an almost six-fold jump in just two
                years and a global record for this route. The spike eased somewhat in 2024 when
                Panama’s migration service logged 302,203 crossings, down 42% from the prior year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 2023 surge had many drivers. Changing migration policies across Latin America
                left few legal routes. The U.S. rescinded Title 42 at the start of 2023, ending a
                pandemic-era rule that quickly expelled many asylum-seekers at the border. Even as
                asylum grew harder to secure, word spread that the end of Title 42 opened a brief
                window while a tripartite U.S.-Colombia-Panama plan was still forming.

              <p>
                Panama’s National Migration Service keeps annual totals of those who make it through.
                A chart of yearly crossings from 2018–2024 shows the jagged climb: 8,445 in 2018,
                221,102 in 2019, a dip to 8,594 in 2020 (during COVID), then 133,653 in 2021,
                248,784 in 2022, 520,085 in 2023, and 302,203 in 2024. These public figures were
                confirmed by Panama’s migration authorities and by independent monitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                This trend shows how politics and crisis drive the flow. A wave of Venezuelan
                migrants arrived after 2021, fueling rapid growth. Panama’s new government, in office
                since mid-2024, built fences and imposed fines to slow crossings. They deported some
                who crossed illegally yet allowed tens of thousands from troubled countries to
                continue north.

              <p>
                Aid groups and government records both show hundreds of reported rapes and assaults,
                though experts say the true number is higher. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs
                clinics near the gap and has treated dozens of survivors, warning that cruelty has
                escalated sharply. Official statistics and MSF case data together paint a disturbing
                picture.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chart should compare reported sexual assaults vs. clinical cases from 2018–2024.
                In 2023, Panama recorded only 69 cases of sexual violence on the route, yet MSF
                treated 462 survivors by November. In 2022, the official count was 91 while MSF
                treated 232 people. Survivors often avoid police — they want to keep moving, fear
                retaliation, or are too traumatized — so aid clinics see many more cases.

              <p>
                IOM’s Missing Migrants Project tracks fatalities here. Deaths spiked in 2024 even as
                crossings dipped slightly. A bar chart of fatalities by year would highlight recent
                jumps: 2024 saw 174 documented deaths or disappearances, surpassing the previous 146
                in 2022. Lower figures in 2020–2021 reflect fewer migrants — and 2024’s tally only
                covers January through August.
              </p>
              <div class="embed-placeholder">&lt;DataWrapper embed&gt;</div>
              <p>
                A breakdown of causes of death shows drowning as the top killer. Migrants cross
                countless rivers, and strong currents sweep hundreds away. Other frequent causes
                include exposure to harsh weather, accidental injuries, and violence or extortion.
              </p>
              <div class="embed-placeholder">&lt;DataWrapper embed&gt;</div>
              <p>
                Migrants also perish off-season. A monthly fatalities chart that aggregates all
                years peaks in January (125 deaths) and March (94). January is especially lethal as
                post-holiday caravans surge before spring rains return; IOM noted that January–March
                2024 was unusually deadly.
              </p>
              <div class="embed-placeholder">&lt;DataWrapper embed&gt;</div>
              <p>
                One heartbreaking statistic is the number of children who die en route. Data records
                22 child fatalities in 2024 alone, up from 15 in 2022 and 14 in 2023. All of the
                deaths recorded in 2024 were among children under age five.

              <h3>Root Causes and the American Dream</h3>
              <p>
                The numbers above — crossing totals, nationalities, sexual assaults, and fatalities —
                all reflect deeper push and pull factors. Migrants in the Darién Gap flee crises or
                chase opportunity. Nearly all come from countries suffering violence, poverty, or
                natural disaster. Venezuelans cite hyperinflation and food shortages; Haitians cite
                gang warfare and political collapse; migrants from Asia and Africa cite human rights
                abuses or conflict at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the “pull” side, many migrants are driven by hope for a better life in the United
                States — the so-called American dream. Migrant shelters near the Panama–Costa Rica
                border post information about U.S. asylum policies. The spike in 2023 was partly
                attributed to rumors that the U.S. quietly relaxed entry conditions after Title 42
                ended. Hope travels faster than official policy.
